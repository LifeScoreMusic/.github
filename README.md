The purpose of this repository is to store our Pull Request Template file, and any other [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

This allow us to share and easily maintain a single PR template that will propagate across any repositories owned by LifeScoreMusic.
